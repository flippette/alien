You are a lone survivor stuck on a spaceship.
Your only means of survival is making it to the ship's escape pod.
However you are not alone in this craft, as there is an android and a Xenomorph alien ready to hunt you down.
The android won't hurt you much, but the Xenomorph will kill you instantly if you encounter it.
There are items and a useful tool available on the map.
Try to outmaneuver your enemies and you may win.
There's some fun to be had if you read the code :).
